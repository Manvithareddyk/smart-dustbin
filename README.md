# smart-dustbin
 The Smart Dustbin is an IoT project done using ARDUINO UNO, along with ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and battery jumper wire. 
After giving all hardware and software connections, the Smart Dustbin program will run. The Dustbin lid 
will open when someone comes near it at some range ,then it waits for user to put the garbage and 
automatically closes. SMART DUSTBIN is an ARDUINO based project. Here we are using Arduino for 
code execution, for sensing we used ultrasonic sensor which will open the lid and wait for few seconds. It 
will bring drastic changes in terms of cleanliness with the help of technology. Everything is getting smart 
with  technology for the  betterment of human beings. This helps in maintaining the environment clean with 
the help of technology. It is a sensor based dustbin so it would be easy to access/use for any age group.
